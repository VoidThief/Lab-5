    <p>In July, I was working as an exterior painter for a quick summer job.</p>

    <p>I like to hangout with friends, go outside, and play video games.</p>

    <p>These are 3 couses I am taking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1630-0 - Database Systems</li>
        <li>1620-0 - Fundamental Web Technology</li>
        <li>Math-1310-0 - Technical Math for IT</li>
    </ul>
