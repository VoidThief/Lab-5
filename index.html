    <h1>Me, Myself, and I</h1>
    
    <p>In July, I was working as an exterior painter for a quick summer job. 
        There was an incident where one of my co-workers <em>fell off a 34ft ladder</em> and had to be taken to the hospital. 
        She ended up getting a <strong>serious</strong> ankle ingury.
    </p>

    <p>I like to hangout with friends, go outside, and play video games. 
        The things I <em>hate</em> are plums, cherries, and <strong>losing</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>These are 3 couses I am taking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1630-0 - Database Systems</li>
        <li><a 
            href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20213048467/">1620-0 - Fundamental Web Technologies</a></li>
        <li>Math-1310-0 - Technical Math for IT</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a picture of my younger self.</p>
